"I'm voting to close  and delete this question as off-topic because it is not answerable and is a pointless question."
"I'm voting to close - question is not about solving problem (creating some table) but how to make one step which OP thinks is right. It's ""solve X using Y"" kind of question."
"I'm voting to close - this is a very specific question which is not to my mind programming related.  If you want to know what version of Java Bb 9.1 uses, I suggest you read its documentation rather than asking Stack Overflow."
"I'm voting to close (and downvoting) this question because it's unclear what's wanted and because the question was changed after answers were posted."
"I'm voting to close (and I normally don't vote to close Code-Golf questions) because this is a bit of a 'too localized' question.  You're going to get an answer from the subset of people that know Code-golf and want to spend the time writing a regex machine in code-golf. Besides painful, it's not very educational. It'd be better to write one **not* in code-golf-ese, so others can learn from it."
"I'm voting to close (and ultimately delete) this question as it was a simple typographical error."
"I'm voting to close : migrate to [DataScience.SE](http://http://datascience.stackexchange.com)"
"I'm voting to close 1) because this is not really a specific question but far to general, 2) because the information is likely to grow stale as Scala evolves and 3) because the general case is already well-defined by [Scala's own documentation](http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/collections-api/collections.html), which is probably a better resource for such broad investigations (and Scala, unlike many other languages, has quite extensive, if sometimes quite challenging documentation)."
"I'm voting to close as ""blatantly offensive""."
"I'm voting to close as ""can't reproduce"". Nothing seems wrong on visual inspection and OP isn't posting any more details."
"I'm voting to close as ""not a real question"" solely because absolutely no context was given outside what you could infer from the code itself.  Since the context is being inferred by potentially bad code (hence the code review), it's not a good question, as all good design decisions rely on a good grasp of the context."
"I'm voting to close as ""not a real question"".  Alternately, I could define it as a question about elementary arithmetic and close it as ""off topic""."
"I'm voting to close as ""not a real question"". Try the Developers group in Google+."
"I'm voting to close as ""not a real question."" Eric's suggestion for revising this question is a good start, but I think the question ""Given a Cartesian plane, how to discretize it in a matrix form?"" is still too vague. I think you should rephrase it about the best way to understand row-major order. If this is closed, I could see myself voting to reopen after substantial revision."
"I'm voting to close as ""Too Broad"". You haven't made an attempt to send the email, and you haven't described how you'd want to send the email (SMTP, SendGrid, file pickup, Exchange Web Services etc)."
"I'm voting to close as ""Too broad, simple typographical error""."
"I'm voting to close as ""too localized"" as this is essentially a ""debug my code"" question.. You are using visual studio so just do a step-by-step debug through it to see where you are performing a bad write.

If you use STL rather than raw pointers it will actually inform you of your bounds error at the time you make it.

You can also use some memory checking tool. They're not free but your company should invest in one."
"I'm voting to close as ""too localized"".  My belief is we're just seeing an artifact of the way ideone.com collects its output."
"I'm voting to close as ""unclear what you're asking"", as you appear to be talking about four or five different things and haven't connected the dots very well.  What files are being compared? What exactly takes ""too long"" and what do you mean by that. What's PHP got to do with it?  Why are you working with strings at all?  If you want good advice, then you'll have to be much more clear about exactly what you are doing.  Though you answered your own question (which is fine), this is certainly an example of [an XY Problem](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem)."
"I'm voting to close as ""Unclear What You're Asking"", which is obvious given there's at least 3 interpretations in the comments and answers here."
"I'm voting to close as ""unclear what you're asking"". I didn't see the previous versions, but as of the last edit it doesn't make sense, because the second largest number of `[-1, -2]` is `-2`, not `-1`. If you are trying to deal in absolute values as in the accepted answer then it isn't clear what should happen if there is a tie for second largest (say, both 2 and -2 in an array with positive and negative numbers)."
"I'm voting to close as *too-broad*, because this is either a recommendation Q (off-topic) or gimmethecode Q (off-topic). Anyway, as @Tom says, getting all the attachments is a simple matter of a custom [`WP_Query`](http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query) and then, with an array of thumbs URLs, do the PHP Zip. And, sure, build your [own plugin](https://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin) to do this."
"I'm voting to close as *unclear what you're asking*, because it's unclear where the error is being raised from, and what ""the second row"" means or stands for."
"I'm voting to close as “too localized” because this question is unlikely to be useful to anyone else in the future. This isn't a bad thing, it just means that this question isn't a good fit for Stack Overflow."
"I'm voting to close as a duplicate of [asp.net gridview paging](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3594639/asp-net-gridview-paging) because you should requery rather than store the results in the Session object. You'll likely run into problems if you do not rerun the query."
"I'm voting to close as a duplicate of http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1145022
(Evidently my search-fu wasn't good)"
"I'm voting to close as a duplicate of your earlier identical question. Please don't ask questions twice, as it just wastes people's time through duplicated effort. Bear in mind that if you do this a lot, the resultant and deserved downvotes may trigger a temporary question ban on your account."
"I'm voting to close as a possible duplicate of [Force Git to overwrite local files on pull](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1125968/force-git-to-overwrite-local-files-on-pull). I'm not sure how close a duplicate it is because many of the answers provided did not work for me (like `git reset --hard HEAD`). I deleted the local folder and re-checked out because it was easiest than continuing to try things to see what worked."
"I'm voting to close as a typo. You can delete the question if that's all it was."
"I'm voting to close as an exact duplicate of the question above because there's nothing new here really - the first line is vulnerable to SQL injection and that should never be allowed to happen. No matter whether the user can use the vulnerability to log in or not - he can break the query and that mustn't happen."
"I'm voting to close as cannot reproduce. If you have more information, then we can reopen and look at it."
"I'm voting to close as duplicate because there is no ""compression"" as such in HTML, just the removing of white space, which can be fixed by a HTML formatter."
"I'm voting to close as I can't reproduce this. I tried your code with typos corrected and I didn't get the results you report."
"I'm voting to close as it still isn't exactly clear to me what you're asking."
"I'm voting to close as no-one can work out what the question means, and OP has refused to actually update the question, despite being repeatedly asked."
"I'm voting to close as off topic, as this is no software development quesiton and a better fit for Super User."
"I'm voting to close as off-topic because this was just a typo."
"I'm voting to close as off-topic because we are not GoDaddy support. (And to be honest, the question is also I indecipherable)."
"I'm voting to close as off-topic since there is no ""bug"" per se in the code, it's just slower than the OP desires. I think this question is a better fit for dba.stackexchange.com. Their help page says that on-topic questions include ""Database Administration including configuration and backup / restore,     Advanced Querying including window-functions, dynamic-sql, and query-performance"""
"I'm voting to close as opinion based but ^ points up to the head and $...well we don't have a down arrow..."
"I'm voting to close as opinion based, but since I'm here, how about [this](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wbYxP.png)?"
"I'm voting to close as opinion-based, but FWIW I'd go for the test. Your try...catch as it stands will catch any error and you'd only be assuming that it is because there is no ID in the DB"
"I'm voting to close as opinion-based, but my opinion is that you should create a class called `Unit`, for example, that defines an `__init__` method that takes `gold`, `wood`, `stone`, and `iron` as parameters and sets them all as attributes of the instance.  You could then say `spearmen = Unit(5, 30, 0, 10)` and use `spearman.gold * 1200`.  Since you are using just one class, you don't need to define a new one for each new kind of unit."
"I'm voting to close as opinion-based.  If you find a reliably-sourced statement from the Java designers that would answer this question, I could be convinced to vote to reopen."
"I'm voting to close as primarily opinion based, since only an R-core member could confirm whether or not this is a bug."
"I'm voting to close as primarily opinion-based because this question is only superficially about Django -- it is primarily about how to lay out a database schema. There are many good answers on this point, and trade-offs between query speed (""querying the database should be efficient"") and [normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization)."
"I'm voting to close as subjective and argumentative, this is too broad to be answered well. There are however some related questions: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10515/php-on-iis"
"I'm voting to close as this error was caused by a simple typographical error."
"I'm voting to close as this is a duplicate but I believe that title is terrible and didn't yield a hit for me."
"I'm voting to close as this is asking for a recommendation of a **tool or software library**."
"I'm voting to close as this is explicitly not programming related.  Any programmer here will tell you to just learn HTML/CSS."
"I'm voting to close as this question belongs to: http://vi.stackexchange.com/"
"I'm voting to close as this question is so broad that it's impossible to actually answer. However, you may find [this](http://evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html) useful."
"I'm voting to close as this questions lacks sufficient detail (MCVE)."
"I'm voting to close as this seems to resolve essentially to the same problem you described in the other question - possible duplicate of [What causes DMV to show a NULL query plan?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14326146/what-causes-dmv-to-show-a-null-query-plan)"
"I'm voting to close as this thread looks like its turning into ""library recommendation"" advice and will attract opinionated answers."
"I'm voting to close as too broad - type inference is covered in the C# spec.  If you're asking why _your specific code_ won't compile that's one thing, but asking for all rules of type inference is too broad."
"I'm voting to close as too broad .... You are still too far from the final goal at least search first how to put aside your divs `float` or `inline-block` here on SO got tons of questions about that...Then go to the JS part searching about change position of an element."
"I'm voting to close as too broad because different architectures have different strategies but in a general sense there is usually a well-defined entrypoint in a code segment that the kernel knows to jump to as the start of a program.  Could be offset 0x1000, or 0 or something else, but compiler writers know what is expected on the platform they are targeting and generate code & link accordingly."
"I'm voting to close as too broad right now because it's hard for me to tell what your actual question is as written. You are asking, I think, how to get an algorithm to work without requiring user input, but nowhere in your posted code do you ask for any. You should post a _representative_ example of your code and exactly how your files are formatted."
"I'm voting to close as too broad, since it does several things, depending on location. You will need to research more on your own first. See e.g. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/413898/what-does-the-static-keyword-do-in-a-class and other SO questions."
"I'm voting to close as too broad."
"I'm voting to close as too broad.  As a quick pointer: the concepts are independent.  Read about subclasses here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming and about windows and subviews here https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/WindowsViews/Conceptual/ViewPG_iPhoneOS/Introduction/Introduction.html"
"I'm voting to close as too broad.  I'd suggest that you start with a simpler question."
"I'm voting to close as too broad. look up ""node asynchronous code"", find a promise library, etc."
"I'm voting to close as too broad. The answer is *Computers and Typesetting* by Donald Knuth, v1-4. Pragmatically, I'd suggest trying to use MathJax."
"I'm voting to close as too broad. To explain this thoroughly, we'd need to give you an overview of **Java generics**. It's a big topic, so you are best to read the link I posted in my first comment and consider another question if you are still stuck."
"I'm voting to close as Too Localized as legal advice this specific is probably better handled through other channels."
"I'm voting to close as too localized, because the status of beta-level development tools will change over time.  Therefore, the answers here won't necessarily remain accurate."
"I'm voting to close as too-broad, because there are a bundle of ways to do this. You could mimic how Gitlab and most Node badge services handle it, with a central server that returns an image (or in your case, version number). You could write an endpoint in your services to do that, set it up in a balancer or proxy, all kinds of ways."
"I'm voting to close as typo because of the OP's explanation in [this revision](http://stackoverflow.com/revisions/38669603/3)."
"I'm voting to close as unclear because I don't understand your background assumptions. The ""clean way"" to create a ""dynamically sized array"" in Python is: `[]`. Lists themselves are already dynamically sized arrays. Likewise, nothing in Python needs to be initialized with blank spaces to some pre-defined size."
"I'm voting to close as unclear because in comments you've acknowledged that you need to delete the part of the code that Andrew mentioned yet you've then said you're going to go sleep now apparently without fixing that - that is, you've deliberately chosen to leave errors in your question. Plus there seems to be a bunch of irrelevant code shown. We're happy to help you in a general sense, but you shouldn't make us wade through misleading or irrelevant details to figure out what you're doing."
"I'm voting to close as unclear since you're purposefully misleading and providing an unnecessary abstraction of the task at hand."
"I'm voting to close as unclear. Because it is. You have not provided with enough information to fully understand the question. Please read my comment above."
"I'm voting to close as unclear. Rails has many components - and it depends wildly on what you ""strip out"" whether thing will work at all. The OP does not mention what his intention is either."
"I'm voting to close as unclear. You should read more [about the bootstrap[(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping) and if you're confused ask on Stats.stackexchange. You don't have a single bootstrap dataset, you have 1000 bootstrap data sets because you set R = 1000. Each one of the 1000 will use a different sample (with replacment) of your original data."
"I'm voting to close as unreproducible."
"I'm voting to close as you need a tool for this, and SO is not for asking for tool recommendations.  Google for ""Java CSV"" and you should find some tools on your own.  Try them out and if you have problems coding, post your specific problems."
"I'm voting to close at the moment as this is not constructed as a question. Could you reword it into a question and then post your solution as an answer?"
"I'm voting to close at this is extremely broad, not directly programming related and partly answered in other questions like http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3273800/what-are-business-objects-and-what-is-business-logic."
"I'm voting to close because _Questions seeking debugging help (""why isn't this code working?"") must include the desired behavior, a specific problem or error and the shortest code necessary to reproduce it in the question itself_."
"I'm voting to close because I can't figure out what in the heck it's asking."
"I'm voting to close because I can't understand from the question what the requested field is."
"I'm voting to close because I don't know what ""Is using more register help us doing in so? "" means."
"I'm voting to close because I don't this a good question for StackOverflow, it's too big..."
"I'm voting to close because it is not clear what you are asking"
"I'm voting to close because it's a **very broad** topic that cannot be handled in a Q & A format. I would suggest you start learning about [ASP.Net Identity](http://www.asp.net/identity). Your question should be immediately answered as you go through the first steps, but as you will see, it's really a broad subject matter covering various options/frameworks. Hth.."
"I'm voting to close because it's just a typo. it's obvious that `wb` got took for a part of the path. not downvoting because the format of the question is good, though."
"I'm voting to close because not enough code is shown to reproduce the issue."
"I'm voting to close because the exact error message isn't given, and its difficult to evaluate the severity of a ""warning"" (perhaps mixing up terminology with an ""exception"")."
"I'm voting to close because the OP's problem doesn't occur in current versions of PhantomJS so it's not relevant."
"I'm voting to close because the OP's solution makes it off-topic in retrospect (it wasn't a programming issue)."
"I'm voting to close because the problem is caused by a simple typographical error and can't be reproduced"
"I'm voting to close because the problem turned out to be specific about the actual website you put in, and not actually anything really to do with the code or the methodology, so unlikely to help future viewers."
"I'm voting to close because the question is unclear"
"I'm voting to close because there are too many questions in your post, and all of them have subjective answers. I think it's an excellent conversation to have, but I don't think StackOverflow is the place to have it. Perhaps mark it community wiki, and we could argue!"
"I'm voting to close because this has nothing to do with programming."
"I'm voting to close because this is a question better suited for ServerOverflow. But to answer the question, the cloud service was a network isolation container into which compute resources are placed. It is used for Azure PaaS and IaaSv1 resources. Its considered ""legacy"" and is not present in Azure's new IaaSv2 which is based on the new Azure Resource Manager model."
"I'm voting to close because this is definitely not a complete question without a demonstration of effort on your part; but it did look really fun, so I tried it anyway.  In the future please include any relevant code, particularly your attempt at solving the issue.  Regardless, here is what I was able to come up with: https://jsfiddle.net/8akxn0xn/.  I recommend running it through an auto-prefixer if you intend on using it in any kind of production environment though."
"I'm voting to close because this is essentially a mysql vs postgres question -- which one is better for any specific task is a matter of much debate, especially because different criteria for ""better"" will bring different answers. _Maybe_ if you had more specific description of your application, data use, any replication required, it'd be more answerable, but the better approach would be for you to read more about them both and pick among them for reasons _you_ understand and hold for _important_."
"I'm voting to close because this is just a typo."
"I'm voting to close because this is off-topic for stackoverflow (should be moved to superuser).  To answer your question though use `ENV=$(printenv)`."
"I'm voting to close because this is too broad a question to get good answers on StackOverflow. But I wanted to mention [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) in case that's sufficient for your needs."
"I'm voting to close because this is way too open-ended a question for stack overflow-  you can (and do) fill books on it.  I think Pragmatic Programming and Code Complete were very good, but experience will teach you more than any book."
"I'm voting to close because this isn't a programming question. But since you asked, the embarassingly parallel part is all of the pixels within a single frame. A single 1920x1080 video frame has 8000 16x16 blocks of pixels that can all be processed simultaneously."
"I'm voting to close because this isn't a programming question. The cluster means is the mean value of the column for that cluster, e.g. the mean of Sepal.Length for cluster 1 is 5.0.  The 88.4% is an indication of GOF, and is the between sum of squares divided by the overal sum of squares.  Any introductory text on cluster analysis should explain this in much more detail."
"I'm voting to close because this question is tagged JS, but has no JS attempt. Please edit and show us what you have tried before you request code from us."
"I'm voting to close because this question is way too overly broad.  To answer your question: start with an API, Facebook and twitter both provide one"
"I'm voting to close because we still haven't gotten relevant information about OP's expectations."
"I'm voting to close because you can just as easily test that crap out or read the documentation."
"I'm voting to close because you don't seem to even ""demonstrate a minimal understanding of the problem being solved"". If the docs don't make sense for this simple API, perhaps it's time to do something else, or to open a question about how better to read and understand the docs on one of other stackexchange sites."
"I'm voting to close because your code [doesn't meet the requirements for an MCVE](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve). It's possible that the problem might be elsewhere; you might be misdiagnosing, and in doing so, wasting all of our time."
"I'm voting to close because you've provided us nothing to analyze. Code, please."
"I'm voting to close because, from my understanding, it turns out this is not really a problem at all.  What the OP is trying to do should work."
"I'm voting to close because, while arguably interesting, there doesn't seem to be a *programming* problem here."
"I'm voting to close because... **1)** This is not a programming question, is it? **2)** No link to check the problem in action. **3)** Unbelievable that the Android browser can now display Flash Player content (is it default Chrome or some other app)?"
"I'm voting to close due to typographical error (hint: that's not how you reference variables)."
"I'm voting to close for I believe this is an homework assignment and I can't see how OP made any effort to solve their problem. Maybe they were encouraged by their [first successful attempt for a cheap solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38824670/assembly-reverse-a-string)?"
"I'm voting to close for now because there isn't enough information to actually answer the question, all we can do is guess. Happy to retract/reopen if the question becomes more specific."
"I'm voting to close for the usual reason with such questions. A quick glance at Amazon will turn up 000s of books on algorithms which do not use C/C++ as their pedagogical language.  Why, even TAOCP doesn't and almost any Google for 'Introduction to Algorithms' will find works by Knuth."
"I'm voting to close it as ""opinion based"", but your approach seems fine."
"I'm voting to close it as primarily opinion-based (and too bread also), and such questions are not for this site. However, if ""Modified/Bubble, Selection or Insertion"" are the only sorting methods you know, then you definitely need more reading on this."
"I'm voting to close it, the code might still be useful to someone searching for a similar problem."
"I'm voting to close just because while the OP has asked this in a slightly different fashion the main issue here is the difference between how to run native code and virtual machine one."
"I'm voting to close just because your formatting offends me. Try harder. This isn't your first rodeo."
"I'm voting to close my own question as there was no problem with the code. Turned out a previous line in real code was truncating the line before the brace."
"I'm voting to close my own question; at the time it was written, the landscape was barren and even one or two answers was a miracle. But now there seem to be plenty of tools and the answers are just going to turn into a poll over time."
"I'm voting to close my question. It's probably too localized, and my method was more or less correct anyway. It would've been better suited for a graphics forum. The act of writing the question helped me solve the problem."
"I'm voting to close now. This is way stupid."
"I'm voting to close on ""lacking sufficient information to diagnose problem"" until the full `cellForRowAtIndexPath:` implementation is included in the question."
"I'm voting to close since the answer in the other question discusses the pro and cons of one dbcontext per application, and one per instance of work, which is what you are asking here as well."
"I'm voting to close since this doesn't appear to be a question. Also, R is not the right language to try to reimplement basic algorithms, since they are already implemented. See `?sort` or `?order` for instance. There's non purpose to reinvent the wheel."
"I'm voting to close since this question it too broad."
"I'm voting to close since we have no way of knowing that your intentions are good.  There are other places on the web where people do not care as much as we do about protecting peoples rights."
"I'm voting to close since you didn't give nearly enough information. Where is the haskell code? How are you trying to build this?"
"I'm voting to close that question, as he does not provide enough information to answer properly."
"I'm voting to close the (my own) question.  The problem is that the code is in a multi-line lambda, and ReSharper is set to put statements on separate lines.  Since that is the desired behavior for code-cleanup, I'm just going to refactor such parameters into variable before calling the function.  Not my code, but I have to live with it, so I may as well clean it up a bit."
"I'm voting to close the [other question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7260997/javascript-continue-with-function-after-another-function-call-finishes) I started, since it may have confused some people."
"I'm voting to close the question (it is unclear...) because it has changed so much."
"I'm voting to close the question anyway; this is basic user-stuff."
"I'm voting to close the question as ""no longer able to reproduce"" because, well, that's the case. But you should accept this answer, and it gets a +1 from me, and well done for figuring it out. :)"
"I'm voting to close the question as ""No Longer Reproducible"";  in it's current state, it's not **obvious** that the problem doesn't exist, and people may continue to attempt to offer answers, which shouldn't happen."
"I'm voting to close the question as I've found the correct solution on how to separate my widgets from my core (which was the idea behind all this). I'm not sure this should even work in TypeScript (as I described). Thanks for your input anyway :)"
"I'm voting to close the question as too broad (although it also seems to be opinion-based and asking for a software recommendation).  I will add, though, that you may have a use case where a NOSQL database with relaxed ACID functionality could be the solution you are looking for."
"I'm voting to close the question for it's off-topic on SO. I'm sorry."
"I'm voting to close the question since it lacks a MCVE."
"I'm voting to close the question since it's a simple typo resolved in a manner which is unlikely to help others."
"I'm voting to close the question, because it can't be answered (see OP's answer below)"
"I'm voting to close the question."
"I'm voting to close the question. It seems that you can no longer reproduce the problem. Neither I can."
"I'm voting to close the question. Your link is wrong or out of date there's nothing anybody can do to help you apart from google on your behalf."
"I'm voting to close this - not only cause I'm offended that you said that ASP.NET MVC is DEAD.  There are no hard and fast rules for migrating code from one technology to another, we can't know what the precise structure is of the code in your Controller/Action methods so can't comment on what is appropriate, it would have to be on an individual action basis.  Also SignalR has an issue that you've identified but [you were able to get to the bottom of it](http://stackoverflow.com/a/33166650/894792) by reverting back a version."
"I'm voting to close this ""question"" as off-topic because there is no question and this is a legal statement rather than a programming related question."
"I'm voting to close this ""solution"" as off-topic because Stackoverflow is for questions and answers, not for solutions. It should be posted in a question format first, and then the author can answer themselves if desired."
"I'm voting to close this (version of your) question.  I suggest that you wait for answers to the other version (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12660694/carry-out-the-operation-in-matlab) before complicating your life by trying to make a contour plot."
"I'm voting to close this *'gimme teh codez'* request as off-topic because it is patently inadequate as an [SO](http://goo.gl/whPhMk) question and could in no way benefit any future viewer. The OP has not demonstrated even a rudimentary knowledge of the platform; has shown no original effort beyond a list of requirements and sample data. This question is worthless to [SO](http://goo.gl/whPhMk) on every level that a question is measured by."

"I'm voting to close this as too broad for SO, but to kind of answer the question in comment form, I think you need to take a step back and ask yourself *why* do people want different fonts and layouts? Is it there own preference, accessibility requirements, vision problems, etc? To an extend, you as the developer can dictate the font choice and layout given the requirements and, as long as the user experience is sound, require users to train on the new layout.

"I'm voting to close this because it's sort of a time sink and there are too many variables. I never did figure out, but it's isolated to a single copy of the repo, so it became corrupted somewhere apparently and it doesn't seem worth the time to continue to investigate. Thanks."
"I'm voting to close this because it's unclear what you're asking.

"I'm voting to close this because you aren't asking a clear question.  Try rephrasing so we know what you want to do.  Just creating a button is as simple as new Button(), then adding it to a layout.  But I don't think that's really what you want to know."
"I'm voting to close this because you seem to be missing some fundamentals about Haskell's syntax, and that would makes answering this question much more difficult than it should be. I second @Kwarrtz's suggestion that you have a look at [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters), it's a great reference and tutorial for people just getting into the language.

"I'm voting to close this mainly because it borderline on the opinion spectrum. None of the options are bad options, it's heavily dependent on what you want to achieve and how you're going to use the logs. I'd say using a library is perhaps a cleaner way of doing things and odds are someone has already implemented good rotation strategies for you. But if you just need debug stuff maybe even a simple `print()` will do the trick for the time being. It all depends on what you want to get out from this. I'd say stick to `syslog` if you're on linux for instance, it's a good generic solution."
"I'm voting to close this on the basis that you havn't tried anything yourself (which is a requirement in the FAQ) but also because this literally is explain in the first google-hit I got. I'm not trying to be rude, i'm simply trying to get everyone asking the most basic introduction questions to learn how to gather information. It's been asked before (see my source list) and it's also on every guide on the internet. They clearly states `in a terminal, write pyinstaller ...`. It might sound harsh but really it's stairing you in the face this time."

Even the error text - `No such signal QMessageBox::msgBox.buttonClicked` should have alerted you, notice QMessageBox:: **msgBox** .buttonClicked."

"I'm voting to close.  This is like asking, _""what do I put inside the `<body></body>`?""_ or _""what do I put inside my CSS file?""_"
